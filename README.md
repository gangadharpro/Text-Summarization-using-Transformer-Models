# Text-Summarization-using-Transformer-Models
This project compares Transformer-based, CNN-based extractive, and LSTM-based abstractive models for long-form text summarization. It evaluates accuracy, readability, and coherence using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, aiming to determine if Transformers outperform traditional models.
